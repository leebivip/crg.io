              <p>My experience producting content for mobile devices begin in the year 2001 where I managed the production of ringtones and graphics for a very early player in the mobile content space: <strong>Premium Wireless Services</strong> (eventually purchased by <strong>InfoSpace</strong>). My career path then led me to <strong>Warner Bros.</strong> and <strong>Universal Music</strong> where I was the head of production for all mobile content at both organizations (and effectively responsible for tens of millions of dollars in yearly revenue.)</p>
              <p>While the importance of mobile personalization content has waned since the mid-to-late 2000's, the importance of providing users with rich, engaging content experiences has not. I embrace the ongoing challenge of creating content experiences in mobile applications that serve value to end users, all while maintaining the highest standards that top content publishers expect.</p>
